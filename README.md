# CHURN Prediction of a Bank

Leveraging the power of Keras in Python, I meticulously constructed and fine-tuned a sophisticated ANN model to effectively predict customer churn. Through iterative model development and optimization, I achieved remarkable accuracy in forecasting churn events, enabling the business to proactively address potential customer attrition.

# Data Collection:
Gathered comprehensive customer data, including transaction history, engagement metrics, and demographic information.
Acquired data from various sources and ensured data quality and consistency.

# Data Preprocessing:
Conducted thorough data cleaning, addressing missing values and handling outliers to ensure data integrity.
Performed feature engineering to extract relevant customer behavior attributes and transformed categorical variables into numeric representations suitable for ANN modeling.

# Model Development:
Utilized Keras to design and implement an ANN model with multiple layers to capture complex patterns in the data.
Configured the model architecture, including the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions, through iterative experimentation to achieve optimal performance.

# Model Training and Validation:
Split the dataset into training and validation sets to train the ANN model effectively.
Employed techniques like cross-validation and early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure generalizability of the model.

# Churn Prediction:
Applied the trained ANN model to predict customer churn based on their historical behavior and attributes.
Analyzed the model's churn predictions and identified key factors influencing customer attrition.

# Actionable Insights and Recommendations:
Presented the findings to cross-functional teams, providing data-driven recommendations to optimize customer retention strategies.

This project demonstrated my expertise in data preprocessing, ANN modeling, and data analysis, as well as my ability to translate complex models into actionable business insights. The successful implementation of the churn rate prediction model significantly contributed to enhancing customer retention and informed data-driven decision-making within the organization.
