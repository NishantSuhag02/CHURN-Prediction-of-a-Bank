# CHURN-Prediction-of-a-Bank

Leveraging the power of TensorFlow/Keras in Python, I meticulously constructed and fine-tuned a sophisticated ANN model to effectively predict customer churn. Through iterative model development and optimization, I achieved remarkable accuracy in forecasting churn events, enabling the business to proactively address potential customer attrition.

# Data Collection:
Gathered comprehensive customer data, including transaction history, engagement metrics, and demographic information.
Acquired data from various sources and ensured data quality and consistency.

# Data Preprocessing:
Conducted thorough data cleaning, addressing missing values and handling outliers to ensure data integrity.
Performed feature engineering to extract relevant customer behavior attributes and transformed categorical variables into numeric representations suitable for ANN modeling.

# Model Development:
Utilized TensorFlow/Keras to design and implement an ANN model with multiple layers to capture complex patterns in the data.
Configured the model architecture, including the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions, through iterative experimentation to achieve optimal performance.

# Model Training and Validation:
Split the dataset into training and validation sets to train the ANN model effectively.
Employed techniques like cross-validation and early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure generalizability of the model.

# Model Evaluation:
Assessed the performance of the trained ANN model using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of model results to gain insights into its predictive capabilities.

# Churn Prediction:
Applied the trained ANN model to predict customer churn based on their historical behavior and attributes.
Analyzed the model's churn predictions and identified key factors influencing customer attrition.

# Actionable Insights and Recommendations:
Interpreted the model's predictions to derive actionable insights for the business stakeholders.
Presented the findings to cross-functional teams, providing data-driven recommendations to optimize customer retention strategies.

# Deployment and Monitoring:
Integrated the churn prediction model into the existing business systems for real-time monitoring and decision-making.
Implemented mechanisms for periodic model updates to ensure the model remains accurate and up-to-date.

Impact Analysis:
Conducted a post-implementation analysis to measure the impact of the churn prediction model on customer retention and business performance.
Evaluated the effectiveness of the recommended strategies in reducing churn rate and improving customer retention.\

This project demonstrated my expertise in data preprocessing, ANN modeling, and data analysis, as well as my ability to translate complex models into actionable business insights. The successful implementation of the churn rate prediction model significantly contributed to enhancing customer retention and informed data-driven decision-making within the organization.
